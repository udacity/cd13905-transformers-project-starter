    "Now that we've outlined the structure and objectives of this project, let's delve into the core concept: sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This can range from identifying the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of a review to analyzing emotions and opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, sentiment analysis is explicitly framed as a **binary classification task**, where the goal is to determine whether a given movie review is *positive* or *negative*. This task is central to many real-world applications, including customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and recommendation systems. By developing a transformer-based model, you will classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative to tackle the challenge faced by your entertainment company CineScope by enhancing its recommendation system, enabling more accurate and personalized suggestions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reviews labeled as positive will be marked as 1 in the dataset, while negative reviews will be labeled as 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following movie review:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The movie was a rollercoaster of emotions, and I loved every moment of it!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This review is clearly positive as it expresses enjoyment and satisfaction with the movie, hence it will be labelled as *positive* or 1 in the dataset. In contrast:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The plot was predictable, and the acting was subpar. A waste of time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This review conveys a negative sentiment, criticizing both the plot and acting, hence it will be labelled as *negative* or 0 in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "While transformers are often used for generation tasks, they can also be adapted for classification tasks with some modifications to their architecture. You might already be familiar with the tweaks that we will implement in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is the [IMDB dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), provided in the `aclIMDB_v1.tar.gz` file. Upon extracting the file, you will find the following folder structure:\n",

    "- **test/**: Contains labeled data for evaluating the model. Similar to the training data, `pos/` and `neg/` contain positive and negative reviews, respectively.\n",
    "- **unsup/**: Contains unlabeled reviews that are not used in this project.\n",

    "#### Subword Tokenization\n",
    "In earlier tasks, you might have encountered character-level tokenization, where each character in the text is treated as a token. While this is straightforward, it is less efficient and may result in larger input sizes, impacting the performance of transformer models.\n",

Specifically, we will utilize the `bert-base-uncased` tokenizer, which applies **subword tokenization**. Subword tokenization involves two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subword Splitting**: Words are split into smaller components (subwords) based on a predefined vocabulary. For example:\n",
    "   - Input: \"unhappiness\"\n",
    "   - Subword Splits: `['un', 'happiness']`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Token Conversion**: Each subword is then converted into a numerical token ID. For example:\n",
    "   - Subword Splits: `['un', 'happiness']`\n",
    "   - Token IDs: `[1011, 24123]` (values are illustrative and depend on the tokenizer vocabulary).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the `bert-base-uncased` Tokenizer\n",
    "The `bert-base-uncased` tokenizer, developed by Google researchers, is part of the BERT model family. This tokenizer is associated with the `bert-base-uncased` model, which has been widely used for tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and text classification. The tokenizer ensures all text is converted to lowercase and accents are removed, reducing vocabulary size and improving generalization. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: \"I Love Transformers.\"\n",
    "- Subword Splits: `['i', 'love', 'trans', '##formers', '.']`\n",

    "In this section, you will learn how to calculate the validation accuracy for the transformer model on the IMDB dataset. Validation accuracy provides a performance metric that helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Overview\n",
    "The function to calculate validation accuracy will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the model on the validation dataset.\n",
    "- Generate predictions for each batch.\n",
    "- Compare predictions with the true labels.\n",
    "- Compute the percentage of correctly classified examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.  Key Points\n",
    "- **Evaluation Mode**: Calling `model.eval()` ensures that dropout and other training-specific layers are disabled during evaluation.\n",
    "- **No Gradients**: The `torch.no_grad()` context disables gradient computation, reducing memory usage and speeding up validation.\n",
    "- **Predictions**: `torch.argmax(logits, dim=1)` retrieves the index of the highest logit for each sample, which corresponds to the predicted class label.\n",
    "- **Accuracy Calculation**: The function computes the fraction of correct predictions out of the total number of samples, then multiplies by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "After calculating the validation accuracy, incorporate this function into your training loop. Typically, you would call calculate_accuracy at the end of each epoch or after a specific number of training steps. Monitoring validation accuracy over time helps you track performance gains and identify potential overfitting or underfitting issues."
